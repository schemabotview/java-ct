# java-ct

Video-first content for the **Java** concept (core language + Spring), consumed at runtime by the [`graphl-movie`](../graphl-movie) app. Content only — notebooks, narration (`.tts` → `.wav`), authored one-screen slides (`.slide`: a `# Title`, `## ` sub-labels, short prose, fenced code, and `- `/numbered lists with **bold** key terms), and the wiring `manifest.json`. Nothing to build or run here. For the authoring contract and folder layout, see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).

This file is the **course outline** — the human-facing map of modules and sections. It is the plan we author against; the machine source of truth for structure is `manifest.json` (once authored).

**Status:** scaffolded + section spine drafted (**12 modules × ~10 sections = 127 sections**, below). **Modules 01–02 authored end-to-end** — all 22 sections (11 + 11) have `.ipynb` + `.slide` + `.tts`, and `manifest.json` wires them onto `java-jvm` / `java-anatomy` (per-section `scene`/`spine`/`focus`/`highlight`, §01 of each the hook). Module 02 is all `java-anatomy`. `audio/` is empty by design: the owner generates the `.wav`s from `tts/` via Colab, then the manifest `audio` fields resolve. Modules 03–12 not authored yet. Scenes `java-jvm` + `java-anatomy` are ported/registered app-side in graphl-movie; Spring modules (08–12) have **no scene yet**.

## Module spine (from `../java-content`)

The source curriculum is the **12-module Java path** in `../java-content` (the graphl-ux-era repo, source of truth for the notebook split): seven core-language/runtime modules then five Spring modules. The video set keeps all 12 modules — Java + Spring is a lot of ground, so 12 is the agreed exception to the usual ~10-module shape — each normalized to **~10 tight teaching sections** (a section = one narrated slide + scene focus, ≈ one page). The source notebooks run 10–17 `## ` headings each; we consolidate fine-grained beats (merging tightly related items) and drop the reading-only "what we'll cover" / "What's next" scaffolding to land near ~10. **§1 of each module is the hook** — the picture the rest of the module zooms into.

Scene assignment: **core-language modules → `java-anatomy`** (the "grammar of a program" map), **runtime/JVM modules (06, 07) → `java-jvm`** (the source→classloader→memory→execution runtime map). Module 01 straddles both (a runtime intro on `java-jvm`, then language basics on `java-anatomy`). Spring modules **08–12 have no scene yet** — they may ride a related scene as a full-strength backdrop until their own scenes are authored.

## Layout

```
java-ct/
  notebooks/   # one .ipynb per SECTION (one ## section each) — source of truth
  tts/         # one .tts per section (spoken narration script)
  audio/       # one .wav per section (generated from tts/ via Colab)
  slides/      # one .slide per section (authored right-pane title + bullets)
  scripts/     # colab_generate_audio.ipynb (tts → wav)
  manifest.json  # wires sections → notebook / slide / scene / highlight / focus / audio
```

Every artifact for a section shares the stem `<NN>-<SS>-<slug>`.
